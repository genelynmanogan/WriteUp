Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) is a rare infection that damages the material (myelin) that covers and protects nerves in the white matter of the brain.
Causes

The JC virus (JCV) causes PML. By age 10, most people have been infected with this virus. But it hardly ever causes symptoms. However, persons with a weakened immune system are at risk of developing PML. Causes of a weakened immune system include:

    AIDS (less common now because of better AIDS treatments)
    Certain medicines that suppress the immune system. Such medicines may be used to prevent organ transplant rejection or to treat multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, and related conditions.
    Cancers, such as leukemia and lymphoma 

#Symptoms

    Loss of coordination, clumsiness
    Loss of language ability (aphasia)
    Memory loss
    Vision problems
    Weakness of the legs and arms that gets worse 

#Exams and Tests

#Tests may include:

    Brain biopsy (rare)
    Cerebrospinal fluid test for the JCV
    CT scan of the brain
    Electroencephalogram (EEG)
    MRI of the brain

#Treatment

In people with AIDS, treatment to strengthen the immune system can lead to recovery from the symptoms of PML. No other treatments have proved effective for PML.
Outlook (Prognosis)

PML is a life-threatening condition. Talk to your doctor about care decisions.
